## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r F1 Header}
8*8

```

```{r data}
circuits = read.csv("Data(1950_2017)/circuits.csv")
races = read.csv("Data(1950_2017)/races.csv")
results = read.csv("Data(1950_2017)/results.csv")
drivers = read.csv("Data(1950_2017)/drivers.csv")

```


```{r cars}
summary(circuits)
```

```{r races}
summary(races)
```

```{r results}
summary(results)
```

```{r driver s}
summary(drivers)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
boxplot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
